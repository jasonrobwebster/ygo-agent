# Root Directory Context Documentation

## Purpose Statement
The root directory contains the main configuration files, build scripts, and documentation for the YGO Agent system. This directory serves as the entry point and configuration hub for the entire Yu-Gi-Oh! AI agent system.

## Core Abstractions

### `setup.py` - Package Setup Configuration

#### File Purpose
Contains the main package setup configuration for the YGO Agent system, defining package metadata, dependencies, and build requirements.

#### Configuration Sections
- Package metadata: Name, version, description, author
- Dependencies: Required Python packages and versions
- Build requirements: Tools needed for building the package
- Entry points: Command-line scripts and applications

### `xmake.lua` - Build System Configuration

#### File Purpose
Contains xmake build system configuration for cross-platform compilation and building of the YGO Agent system.

#### Configuration Sections
- Build targets: Different build configurations
- Dependencies: System and library dependencies
- Compiler settings: Compiler flags and options
- Platform-specific configurations

### `Makefile` - Build Automation

#### File Purpose
Contains build automation rules and targets for common development tasks in the YGO Agent system.

#### Build Targets
- build: Build the package
- test: Run tests
- clean: Clean build artifacts
- install: Install the package
- publish: Publish to package repositories

### `Dockerfile` - Container Configuration

#### File Purpose
Contains Docker container configuration for the YGO Agent system, enabling containerized deployment and development.

#### Configuration Sections
- Base image: Base container image
- Dependencies: System and Python dependencies
- Application setup: Application installation and configuration
- Runtime configuration: Container runtime settings

### `.gitignore` - Git Ignore Rules

#### File Purpose
Contains Git ignore rules to exclude files and directories from version control.

#### Ignored Patterns
- Build artifacts: Compiled files and build outputs
- Dependencies: Package dependencies and virtual environments
- IDE files: Editor and IDE configuration files
- Logs: Log files and temporary outputs

### `.gitlab-ci.yml` - CI/CD Configuration

#### File Purpose
Contains GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration for automated testing, building, and deployment.

#### Pipeline Stages
- Test: Automated testing
- Build: Package building
- Deploy: Deployment to various environments
- Quality checks: Code quality and security scans

### `LICENSE` - License Information

#### File Purpose
Contains the license terms and conditions for the YGO Agent system.

#### License Details
- License type: MIT License
- Copyright information: Copyright holders and years
- Terms and conditions: Usage and distribution terms

### `README.md` - Project Documentation

#### File Purpose
Contains comprehensive project documentation including overview, installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.

#### Documentation Sections
- Project overview: System description and purpose
- Installation: Setup and installation instructions
- Usage: How to use the system
- API reference: Key interfaces and functions
- Contributing: Guidelines for contributors
- License: License information

### `AGENTS.md` - Agent System Documentation

#### File Purpose
Contains documentation for the AI agent system architecture, including agent types, training methods, and deployment strategies.

#### Documentation Sections
- Agent architecture: System design and components
- Training methods: Reinforcement learning approaches
- Deployment: Production deployment strategies
- Performance: Performance characteristics and benchmarks

## Dependencies Map

### Imports Analysis

Internal Dependencies:
- All subdirectories for system components
- Configuration files for system setup

External Dependencies:
- Python packaging tools
- Build systems (xmake, make)
- Containerization (Docker)
- CI/CD platforms (GitLab)

### Exports Analysis

What this directory exposes and why:
- setup.py - [Package setup and distribution]
- xmake.lua - [Cross-platform build configuration]
- Makefile - [Build automation]
- Dockerfile - [Container deployment]
- Configuration files - [System configuration and CI/CD]

## Integration Points

- **Called by**: CI/CD pipelines for automated builds, developers for manual builds
- **Calls**: All subdirectories for system components
- **Data dependencies**: Package configuration, build settings, deployment configuration
- **Event producers**: Build events, deployment events, CI/CD events
- **Event consumers**: CI/CD systems for automation, users for system setup

## Complexity Indicators

- **Cognitive load**: Low - [Reasoning: Configuration and build system with moderate complexity]
- **Change frequency**: Low - [How often root configuration is modified]
- **Test coverage**: High - [Estimated coverage of configuration testing]
- **Performance sensitivity**: Low - [Whether performance is critical for configuration]
- **Error impact**: Medium - [Blast radius if configuration fails - build/deployment stops]
